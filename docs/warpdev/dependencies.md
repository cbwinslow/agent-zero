# Warp.dev Replica Dependencies

Suggested Python packages for building the Warp.dev inspired interface:

- `textual` – rapid TUI framework with rich widgets
- `rich` – rendering engine used by Textual
- `prompt_toolkit` – advanced command line editing features
- `websockets` – real-time communication for the web UI
