# Warp.dev Replica Project

This directory collects project planning notes for creating a GUI and TUI inspired by [Warp.dev](https://www.warp.dev). The goal is to leverage Agent Zero's capabilities while providing a modern terminal experience.

## Planned Features

- Command palette with searchable history
- AI-assisted command suggestions
- Split panes and session management
- Local and remote file browser
- Integration with Agent Zero tools and MCP servers

## Project Tasks

1. Design interface mock-ups and user flows.
2. Build a prototype TUI using [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io).
3. Create a web-based GUI mirroring the TUI functionality.
4. Connect the interface to Agent Zero's API endpoints.
5. Allow configuration of MCP servers through a settings screen.
6. Package a desktop application using Electron or Tauri (optional).

See `dependencies.md` for the list of suggested Python packages.
