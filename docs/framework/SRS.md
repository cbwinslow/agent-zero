# System Requirements Specification

This document outlines the high level requirements for the Multi-Agent Development Framework.

## Objective

Enable coordinated AI agents to iteratively design, implement, and deploy applications.

## Key Components

- **Agents:** specialized workers handling analysis, coding, and deployment.
- **Orchestrator:** coordinates agents, manages tasks and memory.
- **Knowledge Base:** stores project notes and previous experience.
- **Tools:** Docker, Node.js, Python, and other utilities for building and deploying software.

## Workflows

Each project is represented as an objective broken into tasks and micro-goals. Agents communicate progress and store results in the project directory. The orchestrator monitors agents and keeps context files for cross-agent communication.

## Providers

The framework relies on free or self-hosted LLM providers such as OpenRouter, Ollama, and local Mistral models.
