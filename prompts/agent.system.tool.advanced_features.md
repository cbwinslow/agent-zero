# Advanced Features Tool

You have access to advanced AI capabilities through the `advanced_features` tool. This tool provides:

## Hierarchical Memory System
- **4-tier memory architecture**: Working (immediate), Episodic (events), Semantic (facts), Procedural (solutions)
- Query memories across different tiers with importance filtering
- Automatic memory consolidation and promotion
- Get memory statistics and analytics

## Advanced Reasoning
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Step-by-step problem decomposition
- **ReAct Pattern**: Interleaved reasoning and acting
- Apply different reasoning strategies to complex problems
- Get confidence scores and reasoning quality metrics

## Tool Optimization
- Smart caching of tool results for faster execution
- Parallel execution of independent tools
- Tool performance metrics and statistics
- Tool recommendations based on usage patterns

## Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Query decomposition for complex queries
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword + temporal)
- Knowledge graph integration
- Result ranking and deduplication

        "action": "tool_recommend",
        "query": "web scraping task",
        "top_k": 3
    }
}
```

### Perform Advanced RAG Query
```json
{
    "tool_name": "advanced_features",
    "tool_args": {
        "action": "rag_query",
        "query": "machine learning best practices",
        "top_k": 5,
        "use_kg": true
    }
}
```

### Enable a Feature
```json
{
    "tool_name": "advanced_features",
    "tool_args": {
        "action": "enable_feature",
        "feature": "chain_of_thought"
    }
}
```

### Disable a Feature
```json
{
    "tool_name": "advanced_features",
    "tool_args": {
        "action": "disable_feature",
        "feature": "tool_cache"
    }
}
```

## Available Actions

- `status` - Get status of all advanced features
- `memory_query` - Query hierarchical memory (requires: query, optional: tier, limit, importance_threshold)
- `memory_summary` - Get memory statistics
- `apply_reasoning` - Apply advanced reasoning (requires: problem, optional: strategy='cot'|'react')
- `tool_stats` - Get tool optimization statistics
- `tool_recommend` - Get tool recommendations (requires: query, optional: top_k)
- `rag_query` - Perform advanced RAG query (requires: query, optional: top_k, use_kg)
- `enable_feature` - Enable a specific feature (requires: feature)
- `disable_feature` - Disable a specific feature (requires: feature)

## Memory Tiers

- `working` - Immediate, short-term context (capacity: 50 items, TTL: 1 day)
- `episodic` - Event-based, chronological memories (capacity: 500 items, TTL: 30 days)
- `semantic` - Factual knowledge (capacity: 5000 items, permanent)
- `procedural` - Solution patterns and workflows (capacity: 1000 items, permanent)

## Reasoning Strategies

- `cot` - Chain-of-Thought: Step-by-step breakdown
- `react` - Reasoning + Acting: Interleaved thought and action

## Tips

1. Use **hierarchical memory** to store and retrieve important information across sessions
2. Apply **advanced reasoning** for complex problem-solving tasks
3. Check **tool statistics** to understand which tools work best
4. Use **RAG queries** for sophisticated knowledge retrieval
5. Enable **chain_of_thought** for better reasoning on difficult tasks
6. Query **memory summary** to understand what the agent has learned

## Performance Benefits

- **Faster tool execution** through intelligent caching
- **Better memory retention** with hierarchical storage
- **Improved reasoning** with explicit step-by-step thinking
- **More relevant retrieval** with advanced RAG
- **Data-driven decisions** with tool recommendations
