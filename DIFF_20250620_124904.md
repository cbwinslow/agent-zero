+# System Requirements Specification
+
+This document outlines the high level requirements for the Multi-Agent Development Framework.
+
+## Objective
+
+Enable coordinated AI agents to iteratively design, implement, and deploy applications.
+
+## Key Components
+
+- **Agents:** specialized workers handling analysis, coding, and deployment.
+- **Orchestrator:** coordinates agents, manages tasks and memory.
+- **Knowledge Base:** stores project notes and previous experience.
+- **Tools:** Docker, Node.js, Python, and other utilities for building and deploying software.
+
+## Workflows
+
+Each project is represented as an objective broken into tasks and micro-goals. Agents communicate progress and store results in the project directory. The orchestrator monitors agents and keeps context files for cross-agent communication.
+
+## Providers
+
+The framework relies on free or self-hosted LLM providers such as OpenRouter, Ollama, and local Mistral models.

+# Implementation Tasks
+
+1. Establish base folder structure under `framework/`.
+2. Implement orchestrator to read configs and spawn agent processes.
+3. Define agent templates and default workflows.
+4. Integrate with open source providers (Ollama, OpenRouter) for LLM access.
+5. Build tooling scripts for Docker-based deployment of generated applications.
+6. Document usage examples and command line entry points.

+# Multi-Agent Development Framework
+
+This directory contains a prototype workflow for building applications using cooperating AI agents.
+
+It provides the following structure:
+
+- **agents/** â€“ agent templates and implementations
+- **workflows/** â€“ reusable task sequences
+- **projects/** â€“ saved project state and code
+- **tools/** â€“ scripts and utilities the agents may use
+- **teams/** â€“ definitions of agent teams
+- **configs/** â€“ environment and provider configuration
+- **envs/** â€“ isolated runtime environments (e.g., Docker images)
+
+The framework is intended to work with open source LLM providers such as Ollama and local Mistral models via OpenRouter.
